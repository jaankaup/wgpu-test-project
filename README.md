# Eikonal equation solver

An eikonal equation solver using FIM (fast iterative marhcing) method. The project is implemented using [wgpu-rs](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/rs). The shaders are implemented using GLSL.

## Project features. 

This project implements the following features/algorithms. 

	The Marching Cubes algorithm.
	A Sphere tracer (ray march).
	Fast Iterative Marching (not finished yet.
